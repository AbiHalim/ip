The ChatGPT chat I am using for this project can be accessed at: https://chatgpt.com/share/678f824a-ac2c-8009-98aa-3d963f924adf

## Week 2:
This week (and probably for the whole project), I used ChatGPT-4o to work on the project. I started by feeding it as much context as I could about the project, and for each task I fed it as much context about each task by copying the instructions from the website. It worked very well overall, the only mistakes I encountered were at the end when trying to implement enumerations, which I had to go in and fix manually. While it probably didn't save any time for the earlier tasks which were extremely easy, it saved a lot of time in later tasks which involved writing a lot of code (ie. lots of functions along with their full responses)

## Week 3:
- have to remind chatgpt of most recent version of codebase, sometimes forget
- really useful in avoiding typing out lots of code repetitively (ex. all the different tasks, methods)
- trained it on the course's coding conventions
